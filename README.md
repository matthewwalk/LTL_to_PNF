# LTL_to_PNF
## LTL EDITION
"An application which receives Linear Temporal Logic formulae and converts them to their Positive Normal Form (PNF)"

NOTE: This was the initial edition of the project (hense the name) and has since been discontinued in favour of the project below...

## CTL EDITION
 Recently, I have begun updating the project to support Computational Tree Logic (CTL)
 
 As of now, the library supports the following features:
 
 * Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to Positive Normal Form (PNF) Converter
 * CTL to PNF Converter
 * Basic Propositional Logic solving on CTL formulae
 
 Over the course of the next couple months I plan to implement the following features
 
 * CTL solving in it's entirety (evaluate a Transition System with a CTL Formula)
 * CTL to Existential Normal Form (ENF)
 * CTL expansion of formulae
 * CTL reduction of formula (converse of above)
 * Transition system property verifier (Deadlock free, invariants, etc...)

If you wish to help me achieve these goals, feel free to reach out to me here on Github or via email.

Thanks :)
